## How to collaborate

### Found an issue with the website? 🐛

Check that it is not already listed in the [issues](https://github.com/tmlmt/bodegamap-collab/issues) list. If not, create a new one!

### Want to suggest updated metadata 🗃️ or submit a picture 📷 for some bodega?

Create a new discussion in the [bodegas](https://github.com/tmlmt/bodegamap-collab/discussions/categories/bodegas) catagory of the [discussion](https://github.com/tmlmt/bodegamap-collab/discussions) section.

Regarding pictures, please include your name and the date at which the picture was taken, to properly credit you 😊

### Have an idea? 💡

Open a [discussion](https://github.com/tmlmt/bodegamap-collab/discussions) first in the Ideas category 😊

### Want to translate in another language or a local dialect?

Currently, the website has Danish 🇩🇰 and English 🇺🇸/🇬🇧 translations, but it is structured so that adding new languages is really easy. We just need to set up a good system for proposing translations: if it's not in place yet and you'd like to contribute, no problem, write a message in the [Discussions](https://github.com/tmlmt/bodegamap-collab/discussions) area.

## Rules

Please use English in your communication, so that we enable as many as possible to participate. All issues will be treated in English. There is however [a specific discussion category](https://github.com/tmlmt/bodegamap-collab/discussions/categories/dansk) for discussions in Danish 😊
