# Bodega Map - Collaboration

## Introduction

This repository is meant as a collaboration platform for the [Bodega Map](https://www.bodegamap.com). The Bodega Map is a web application mapping the traditional Danish pubs / locals in the Copenhagen Area, with functionalities for registered users.

## How to collaborate

### Found an issue with the website?

Check that it is not already listed in the [issues](https://github.com/tmlmt/bodegamap-collab/issues) list. If not, create a new one!

### Have an idea?

Open a [discussion](https://github.com/tmlmt/bodegamap-collab/discussions) first in the Ideas category ðŸ˜Š

### Want to translate in another language or a local dialect?

Currently , the website has Danish ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡° and English ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸/ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ translations, but it is structured so that adding new languages is really easy. We just need to set up a good system for proposing translations: if it's not in place yet and you'd like to contribute, no problem, write a message in the [Discussions](https://github.com/tmlmt/bodegamap-collab/discussions) area.

## Rules

Please use English in your communication, so that we enable as many as possible to participate. All issues will be treated in English. There is however [a specific discussion category](https://github.com/tmlmt/bodegamap-collab/discussions/categories/dansk) for discussions in Danish ðŸ˜Š
