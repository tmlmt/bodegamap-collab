  This project is fueled by our passion for the concept of bodegas and was started by a decision to share our practical approach to it: initially, we
  were just looking for a way to find which one we should try next and save our memories. We fully acknowledge that the data presented here is not exhaustive,
  may contain errors, and lack the collective depth and accuracy of the larger community (both patrons of bodegas, journalists, researchers, or enthusiasts
  groups on social media)
