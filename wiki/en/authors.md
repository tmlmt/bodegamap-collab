# ðŸ•º About the authors

Bodega Map is a community project by [tmlmt](https://github.com/tmlmt), inspired by long discussions with [Sacul](https://instagram.com/saculululul)

## Origin of the project

This project is fueled by our passion for the concept of bodegas and was started by a decision to share our practical approach to it: initially, we were just looking for a way to find which one we should try next and save our memories.
