# What is a bodega?

This article attempts to describe what makes a bodega a bodega and what distinguishes them from regular bars.

## Disclaimer

We fully acknowledge that the definition presented here is highly subjective and lack the collective depth and accuracy shared by the larger community (both patrons of bodegas, journalists, researchers, or enthusiasts groups on social media)

## Main characteristics

### 1. Regulars

A bodega is first and foremost a meeting place for the locals, for which it is sometimes seen as an extension of their living rooms. It will always be attended by a few regulars, at any time of day. It is a good sign if your entrance is welcomed by their staring gazes. Some will have their names on a plaque at the counter or at their reserved table.

### 2. Host

Another people-related aspect is the presence of a bartender, whom in a bodega is really like a host and acts as such: in a bodega, they will be known from the regulars, and engaging with them

### 3. Simple and cheap

Contrary to hipster bars, bodegas will have affordable beers and will always offer the classic ones (e.g. Tuborg Gr√∏n) on tap or in bottles. Bonus point if the bottled beers are stored in a case directly inserted in a fridge below the counter.

### 4. Decoration

Bodegas usually have a long history, and are decorated in traditional styles: dim lights; worn-out wooden chairs and tables; beer cask bottoms, old portraits and Danish trivia on the walls; often green, black and red as dominant colors.

### 5. Smoking allowed

Bars under 40m2 in Denmark are allowed to permit their customers to smoke inside, provided they do not serve food. The cosiness and intimacy of small bodegas are often associated with a characteristic smell of cigarettes, which coins the term "Brown Bodegas".
