# 🤝 Collaboration

## Preamble

Although there are already quite a few basic things in place, there is still a lot of room for improvements: some metadata is missing (opening hours, characteristics, osv), as well as pictures, and of course a lot of bodega locations across the country. It takes quite some time, but it will be done step by step! We just started somewhere, with the city we live in 😊

Bodega Map is a community project, so we love contributions of all kind. ❤️

## How to contribute

You can of course use the [contact form](/en/contact) for quick-and-easy suggestions, but we have also put in place a couple of tools to ease the work on our end. Most of them are based on the software development platform _Github_.

### Found an issue with the website? 🐛

Check that it is not already listed in the [issues](https://github.com/tmlmt/bodegamap-collab/issues) list. If not, create a new one!

### Want to suggest updated metadata 🗃️ or submit a picture 📷 for some bodega?

Create a new discussion in the [bodegas](https://github.com/tmlmt/bodegamap-collab/discussions/categories/bodegas) category of the [discussion](https://github.com/tmlmt/bodegamap-collab/discussions) section.

Regarding pictures, please include your name and the date at which the picture was taken, to properly credit you 😊

### Have an idea? 💡

Ideas are listed in the [issues](https://github.com/tmlmt/bodegamap-collab/issues) area, with a specific `feature-request` tag. If your area is already listed, do not hesitate to react on it to "upvote" it. If not, you can either suggest your idea directly in that area as a new issue, or open a [discussion](https://github.com/tmlmt/bodegamap-collab/discussions) in the Ideas category if you want to discuss it first with others.

### Want to translate in another language or a local dialect?

Currently, the website has Danish 🇩🇰 and English 🇺🇸/🇬🇧 translations, but it is structured so that adding new languages is really easy. You are also very welcome to suggest corrections to the existing languages. After all, Danish is not our mother tongue.

There are two ways you can contribute:

#### 1. Indirect contribution by suggesting via a message, or if in doubt

Write a message with your suggestions (corrections, clarification on how to help, wish for a specific translation, etc.) in the [Discussions](https://github.com/tmlmt/bodegamap-collab/discussions) area.

#### 2. Direct contribution via a git pull request

If you'd like to make direct contributions to this repository and you are comfortable using git (we can also help you if you [message](https://github.com/tmlmt/bodegamap-collab/discussions) us), please follow the procedure on [this page](https://github.com/tmlmt/bodegamap-collab#2-direct-contribution-via-a-git-pull-request)

**Thank you !**
