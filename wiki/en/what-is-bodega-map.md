The menubar at the top enables you to:

### For (free) registered users only

#### 1. Add new places to the map

![Add a bodega](/images/wiki/feature-add.webp){class='border-1 border-300' sizes='85vw sm:515px lg:700px'}

Your favorite place is missing on the map? Want to add some other places where you live? Center the map where you'd like to add a new spot, and then click on "Add Bodega" in the user menu (1), drag the red marker to fine tune its location on the map (2), fill in the form and click on submit once you're done (3).

Although the only mandatory field is the name, and you need to place the marker on the map at the right place, please fill in as much as you know about the place as you can. Your contribution is greatly appreciated.

![Review pending](/images/wiki/feature-pending.webp){class='border-1 border-300' sizes='85vw sm:515px lg:700px'}

Once you've submitted the form, a new blue marker will appear (1), and the sidebar will indicate that your submission is pending review from me. Until it's approved, it will only be visible for you and me.

In the meantime, you can already upload pictures to it or suggest further edits: see the next section.

#### 2. Suggest edits to existing bodegas

![Suggest edits](/images/wiki/feature-edit.webp){class='border-1 border-300' sizes='85vw sm:515px lg:700px'}

Are the opening hours not up to date? Or would you like to correct anything else? Click on "Suggest an edit" at the bottom of the sidebar (1). All the fields will become editable. Make any edit you'd like to suggest: most is done in the sidebar (2), only the marker's location is changed by dragging the red marker directly on the map (3). Once you're done, click on Submit at the bottom of the form.

Once you've submitted the form, the edits will be available for review by me. Some indication will appear to inform visitors that some information may be updated soon.

#### 3. Keep track of bodegas you've visited

![Visited flag](/images/wiki/feature-visited.png){class='border-1 border-300' sizes='85vw sm:515px'}

Check or uncheck the flag once you've clicked on the bodega you're visited

#### 4. Use additional filters

![See closed bodegas](/images/wiki/feature-closed.png){class='border-1 border-300' sizes='85vw sm:515px'}

Special filters:

- Show only bodegas you have visited or those you haven't
- Show bodegas that are temporarily or permanently closed
- Show bodegas that you've submitted for review, or hide them
