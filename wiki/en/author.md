# ðŸ•º About the author

Bodega Map is a community project by Thomas Lamant ([@tmlmt](https://github.com/tmlmt) :GithubLogo).

## Origin of the project

This project is fueled by my passion for the concept of bodegas and was started by a decision to share the practical approach to it that I had initially with my friend Sacul: we were just looking for a way to find which one we should try next and save our memories.
