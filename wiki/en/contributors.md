# ‚ù§Ô∏è Contributors

Many thanks to our contributors who have helped in many ways to making the Bodega Map into what it is today. In alphabetical order:

- [A Classic Enthusiast]{.fakelink} who preferred to remain anonymous: picture and corrections suggested for a bodega.
- [Mari Carmen Casermeiro G√°mez :LinkedInLogo{color="#458bfd"}](https://www.linkedin.com/in/maria-del-carmen-casermeiro-g%C3%A1mez-58b84b195): translation into Spanish üá™üá∏
- Sacul ([@saculululul](https://instagram.com/saculululul) :InstagramLogo): many thanks for our endless discussions during our Bodega tours and for having inspired me to create this website.
